# Speech Emotion Recognition using LSTM and Change Point Detection

Welcome to our Speech Emotion Recognition project! This research combines LSTM networks with change point detection to create a powerful system for recognizing emotions in continuous speech.

## üéØ What Does This Project Do?

We've built a dual-stage system that:
- Detects emotional transitions using PELT algorithm
- Classifies emotions using LSTM networks
- Processes speech using MFCC features

## üìÅ What's Inside

- `Notebooks/`: Implementation and experiments
- `iemocap_full_dataset.csv`: IEMOCAP dataset
- `lstm_80Epoch_Imocap.h5`: Trained LSTM model
- `merged_emotions.csv`: Combined emotions dataset
- `segmentationPredictions.csv`: Model predictions
- `notebook links.docx`: Reference documentation

## üìä Results

Our model achieved impressive results across different datasets:

### Combined Dataset
- Training: 99.43% accuracy (0.0216 loss)
- Validation: 88.64% accuracy
- Test: 89.74% accuracy

### IEMOCAP Dataset
- Training: 98.01% accuracy (0.0665 loss)
- Validation: 81.37% accuracy
- Test: 92.34% accuracy

## üîë Key Features

- Real-time emotion detection in speech
- Accurate emotional transition detection
- Robust LSTM classification
- Support for multiple datasets
